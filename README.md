Quantum Simulator 
===

# Goal 
Goal of this project is creating quantum simulator using Tensor Network framework by google.

<!-- TODO -->
### Sub Goal
In order to understand how the state vector and qiskit circuit works, implement grover algorithm with qiskit as the step 1

# Requirement Packages

## Python Version
    Python 3.12.0 

## Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment to install packages in Python app development instead of modifying the system-wide environment will allow you to seperate packages.

### How to start Python Development with Python Environment
#### 1. Install `python3-venv` or `python3.x-venv`

If you system does not have `venv` library, install it using apt.
>   
    sudo apt install python3-venv

#### 2. Navigate to the project directory where you want to create a virtual environment and install the required packages for the quantum simulator.

#### 3. Run the 'venv' module in your designated directory
Replace 'myenv' with your virtual environment name
>
    python3 -m venv myenv

#### 4. Activate the virtual environment:
* For Mac
    >   
    source myenv/bin/activate
* For Window
  * 


## Requirements.txt
The `requirements.txt` file should list all the Python libraries that these code files require, and the libraries will be installed by:
>
    pip install -r requirements.txt
