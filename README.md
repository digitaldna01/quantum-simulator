# Requirement Packages

## Python Version
    Python 3.12.0 

## Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment to install packages in Python app development instead of modifying the system-wide environment will allow you to seperate packages.

### How to start Python Development with Python Environment
1. Install **python3-venv** or **python3.x-venv**

If you system does not have **venv** library, install it using apt.
>   
    sudo apt install python3-venv

1. 

## Requirements.txt
The **requirements.txt** file should list all the Python libraries that these code files require, and the libraries will be installed by:
>
    pip install -r requirements.txt
