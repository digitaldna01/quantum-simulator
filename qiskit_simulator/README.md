## Grover Algorithm
One potential advantage of a quantum computer over a classical computer is its ability to search faster. Imagine a library filled with books, where one page has a big red X. If you wanted to find that specific page, instead of manually searching for it, you could use a computer.

A classical computer would have to search sequentially through each book and then through each page within those books until it found the X. In contrast, a quantum computer could search through all books, or even all pages, simultaneously.

This illustrates how a quantum computer can achieve exponentially faster search speeds than a classical computer.
