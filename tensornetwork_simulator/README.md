# Simulating a Tensor Network Quantum Circuit

Tensor networks are commonly used for quantum circuit simulation. This is because all quantum circuit diagrams correspond exactly to Tensor networks. Once the tensor network is fully contracted, the resulting tensor will equal the quantum computer's wavefunction just before measurement.
